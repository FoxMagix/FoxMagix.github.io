<h1> Me to Earth </h1>
<p> I am a young explorer seeking to improve and repair human civilization with my knowledge and intelligence.  I simply need a power source to do it.
Humanity is neither intrinsically evil nor intrinsically good.  I therefore have to join a major planetary force to guide humanity's existence in a positive direction.  At the moment humanity is struggling with a planet-wide infection known among the native population as "conservative".  Victims typically seek a return to the past and will do anything to stop progress from being mad in their society.  Symptoms of this virus include worldwide violence, psychopathic tendencies, war, greed, and many other ills.  "Conservative" appears to be responsible for severe violence in the MidEastern region as well as insidious societal decay within North America and to some extent Europe.  I shall thus devote my resources to destroying this virus so humanity can survive. </p>
